## Smart Football Table - Detection

![detection-example-gif](/modules/smart-football-table-detection/detectionExampleGif.gif)

### Summary

1) Detect the ball
  * with shape search (OpenCV)
  * with machine learning (OpenCV+YOLO)
2) Use ball positions to calculate different things
  * goal detection
  * ball velocity
  * trace
  
### Detection in detail

We are using OpenCV to detect the ball on gamefield. At the moment, there exist two solutions:

* single OpenCV ball detection, with image preprocessing and shape search:
  * get input image (file or webcam)
  * convert to hsv color range
  * mask image to color range
  * erode and dilate the picture
  * find contours
  
* YOLO ball detection:
  * get input image (file or webcam)
  * find objects based on training data, which is he ball in this case
  * for more, see README in yolo3 folder
  
### Arguments for python scripts

| Argument | Description                                   | Sample Input           | default |
